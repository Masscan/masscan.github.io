I was given two android application to find the flag from it.

The flag format is in **userid:password**.

#### Lets start..

* Application 1 : Backdoor1.apk

I installed the first application on emulator and the application asks for a username and password. I have to find out that.

![Crepe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masscan/masscan.github.io/master/assets/img/are2.png)

First, i used **apktool** to decompile the android application.

~~~
apktool d Backdoor1.apk -o Backdoor1
~~~

After that i checked the strings.xml file, and i found some username and password from there.

But to confirm this i used **jadx** to reverse engineer the application and verified that the username and password found in strings.xml are the correct credentials needed by the application.

~~~
#Login function
public void onClick(View view) {
    if (!TaskActivity.this.edtUserName.getText().toString().equals(TaskActivity.this.getResources().getString(R.string.Ustr)) || !TaskActivity.this.edtPassword.getText().toString().equals(TaskActivity.this.getResources().getString(R.string.Pstr))) {
         Toast.makeText(TaskActivity.this, "Please enter valid data!", 1).show();
         return;
    }
    Intent mIntent = new Intent(TaskActivity.this, SuccessActivity.class);
    Toast.makeText(TaskActivity.this, "You gotchhha!!", 1).show();
    TaskActivity.this.startActivity(mIntent);
    TaskActivity.this.finish();
 }
~~~

This was an easy find. 

Note : **strings.xml file is an important file. most of the time some important information will be leaked there.**

**Flag : RandomUser1:Rand0mP@ss1**

* Application 2 : Backdoor2.apk

Installed the second application on emulator and it was similar to first challenge. After opening the application there is a login activity which asks for username 
and password. We have to find that.

![Crepe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masscan/masscan.github.io/master/assets/img/are4.png)

As always i decompiled the application with **apktool**.

~~~
apktool d Backdoor2.apk -o Backdoor2
~~~

And i checked the strings.xml for any hardcoded username and password.

But nothing was there. After that i used **jadx** to reverse enginner the application and checked how this time login function is implemented.

![Crepe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masscan/masscan.github.io/master/assets/img/are6.png)

As you can see the application creates 2 files "secret_user.pwd" and "secret_pass.pwd" on starting, and that two files contain username and password.

Now checking login function we can see that the entered username and password is checked against the content of that two files.

![Crepe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masscan/masscan.github.io/master/assets/img/are7.png)

So this time the application stores the critical data in local file system.

**Flag : 69c24a9997:377da7f9fa**
